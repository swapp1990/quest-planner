# Written Proposal (1–2 pages) — Side Quests

## Executive summary

Side Quests is a gamified, AI-personalized action app for ambitious women who want to convert big goals into daily execution. The launch campaign is Solo Trip, structured as Act -> Quest -> Steps, with conversational onboarding and LLM-generated quest paths per act. The core business model is freemium + subscription: free users experience the full core loop, premium users unlock additional acts, campaigns, and deeper personalization.

This proposal focuses on competitive positioning and monetization strategy.

## Problem and market gap

Most goal apps fail at the execution layer. Users do not need more inspiration; they need a low-friction, emotionally engaging system that tells them exactly what to do next.

The target audience in this brief (creator-aligned, adventure-oriented women) has a clear pattern:

- High aspiration and intent
- High anxiety at first meaningful action
- Strong response to clear guidance, progress visibility, and celebration

Current products usually optimize for one side only:

- Habit trackers optimize for consistency, but feel generic and emotionally flat
- Travel planning tools optimize logistics, but are transactional and not behavior-changing
- Creator content inspires, but is not operationalized into daily in-app execution loops

Side Quests positions itself in the missing layer between motivation and completion.

## Competitive analysis (specific apps)

This analysis uses the competitor set already documented in the Gabby brief research.

### Direct competitors we analyzed

- **Habitica**: strong RPG habit gamification and community challenges; weak fit for guided life-goal execution due to dated UX and habit-centric framing.
- **Fabulous**: premium polish and guided routines; tends to feel heavy, paywall-forward, and less flexible for user-specific multi-goal planning.
- **SuperBetter**: gameful challenge framing and strong ratings; skews toward resilience/mental-health framing and feels generic unless heavily customized.
- **TaskHero / Level Up Life**: gamified productivity conceptually close, but less differentiated in creator-aligned storytelling and adaptive travel/life-goal flows.

### Indirect competitors we analyzed

- **Streaks / Strides / Habitify / Way of Life**: excellent habit cadence tools, but mostly static templates and weak narrative progression.
- **Todoist / Trello**: strong task execution infrastructure, but no built-in motivation loop or personalized coaching.
- **TripIt Pro** and traditional travel planners: strong logistics utility, but low behavior-change design.

### Side Quests positioning vs these competitors

- **Vs Habitica/Fabulous/SuperBetter:** Side Quests focuses on campaign-driven real-world transformation (Act -> Quest -> Steps), not just habit repetition or generic routines.
- **Vs Streaks/Strides/Habitify/Way of Life:** Side Quests adds conversational personalization and adaptive quest generation, not just tracking.
- **Vs Todoist/Trello:** Side Quests provides guided narrative progression and emotional reward loops, not only project management.
- **Vs TripIt Pro and travel utility tools:** Side Quests targets pre-trip behavior change and confidence-building execution, not itinerary data management.

### Concise competitor comparison

| Product | Core Model | Personalization Depth | Gamification Depth | Best For | Main Gap vs Side Quests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Side Quests** | Act -> Quest -> Steps campaigns | High (chat + LLM-generated per-act quests) | High (progress loops + stamp rewards) | Goal execution with guidance | N/A |
| **Habitica** | RPG habit tracker | Low-Medium | High (RPG mechanics) | Habit consistency | Weaker for structured, personalized life-goal journeys |
| **Fabulous** | Guided routines / habit coaching | Medium | Medium | Wellness habit formation | Less flexible for user-specific, multi-path goal campaigns |
| **SuperBetter** | Gameful self-improvement challenges | Medium | Medium-High | Resilience and mindset challenges | Less domain-specific execution for travel/life-goal planning |
| **Todoist / Trello** | Task/project management | Low | Low | Work/task organization | No narrative guidance or emotional progression loop |
| **TripIt Pro** | Travel logistics utility | Low | Low | Itinerary management | Optimizes logistics, not behavior change and goal execution |

## Product differentiation thesis

The differentiation is not "AI for content." The differentiation is "AI for adaptive execution."

Each Act begins with a chat-style briefing. Responses are mapped into constraints (confidence, budget style, planning energy, risk comfort), and the app generates personalized quests and prompts for that specific user. Two users can choose the same campaign and still receive different quest pathways.

This creates higher relevance, lower friction, and better completion probability compared to static templates.

## Monetization and revenue strategy

### Monetization model overview

| Layer | Goal | What user gets | Business role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | Activation + trust | Campaign onboarding, personalized initial quest generation, core progress loop, reward moments | Proves value before paywall to improve conversion quality |
| **Premium** | Expansion + retention | Full multi-act access, additional campaigns, deeper personalization, advanced rewards | Primary recurring revenue engine |

### Pricing and benchmark snapshot

| Product | Market price reference |
|---|---|
| **Side Quests (target)** | **$4.99/month** or **$29.99/year** |
| Fabulous | ~$39.99/year |
| Habitify | ~$4.99/month or ~$30/year |
| Way of Life | ~$4.99/month |
| Strides Premium | ~$39.99/year |
| TripIt Pro | ~$49/year |
| Streaks | ~$5.99 one-time |

Pricing conclusion: Side Quests is positioned in the mainstream premium range for habit/travel-adjacent apps, with room to drive annual plan adoption and future pack upsells.

### Revenue architecture

| Revenue stream | Timing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subscriptions (monthly/annual) | Immediate | Core RevenueCat-backed recurring revenue |
| Creator-branded campaign packs | Post-MVP | Expansion monetization aligned with creator partnerships |
| Domain packs (career/fitness/creative) | Post-MVP | Increases ARPU and broadens TAM without changing core loop |

### Funnel and KPI dashboard

| Funnel stage | KPI |
|---|---|
| Install -> onboarding complete | Onboarding completion rate |
| Onboarding -> first quest progress | Time to first completed step |
| First quest -> Act 1 complete | Act 1 completion rate |
| Paywall view -> purchase | Paywall conversion rate |
| Subscriber lifecycle | D7/D30 retention, churn, annual plan mix |

North star metric: **% of users completing an Act within first 7 days**.

## Why this monetization should work

The model aligns with user psychology and product architecture:

- Users subscribe after experiencing real progress
- Premium unlock is content and guidance expansion, not arbitrary feature locking
- Personalization increases relevance, which increases completion, which increases willingness to pay

In short: better execution outcomes create better monetization outcomes.

## Near-term go-to-market and roadmap

- Tighten conversion UX around Act completion -> premium continuation
- Launch additional creator-aligned campaigns
- Improve quest generation quality with richer per-act chat signals
- Add retention systems (daily "next best step," streak reactivation, comeback flows)
- Expand creator partnerships where expert guidance can be productized into high-LTV campaign packs

## Closing

Side Quests is built to solve a real problem: helping people move from intention to action when goals feel overwhelming. The focus is not just motivation, but clear next steps and steady progress until completion.

The business model is equally intentional: a meaningful free experience that builds trust, and a premium tier that unlocks more value through additional journeys and deeper personalization. It is designed to be sustainable, user-first, and scalable over time.

This project is personal to me. It is dedicated to my wife, and to young women who want to pursue ambitious goals with confidence. If selected, I will keep improving Side Quests so it remains practical, encouraging, and truly effective at helping users move from dreaming to doing.
