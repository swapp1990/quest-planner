## Unified Briefing Flow for All Acts

- User pointed out Act 2 onboarding was different from Act 1 - wanted same mechanics
- Act 1 had full briefing flow (chat → constraints → plan generation)
- Act 2+ had simpler ActOnboardingModal with just questions
- Refactored CampaignBriefingModal to accept `chapterId` prop
- Created `src/briefing/actBriefingData.js` with act-specific content for all 4 acts
- Each act now has unique prompts, constraints, plans, and gradient colors
- Deprecated ActOnboardingModal (no longer used)
- App.js now uses CampaignBriefingModal for both BRIEFING and ONBOARDING screens

## Project Rename

- Project was showing as "HelloWorld" in Expo Go - confusing when running multiple projects
- Updated app.json: name → "Quest Planner", slug → "quest-planner"
- Updated package.json: name → "quest-planner"
- Changed bundle ID to `com.swapnilsawant.questplanner`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new project info
- For Expo Go, just restart Metro - bundle ID only matters for standalone builds
